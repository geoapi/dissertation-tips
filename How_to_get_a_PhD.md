Becoming a full professional researcher means: 

* that you have something to say that your peers want to listen to 
* have a command of what is happening in your subject so that you can evaluate the worth of what others are doing 
* you must have astuteness to discover where you can make a useful contribution 
* you are aware of ethics of profession and work w/in them 
* have mastery of appropriate techniques that are currently being used, and aware of their limitations 
* able to communicate your results effectively in the professional arena 
* all this carried out in an international context (professional peer group is worldwide) 

*note: these are skills, not knowledge that have to be learned by doing task in practice situations. get feedback

** you are doing research to demonstrate that you have learned how to do research to fully professional standards


How to know the standards for your field: 

* read other PhD theses in your field 
* if you have to ask someone else, then you are not ready because you cannot evaluate research work to fully professional standards 

intelligence gathering = 'what' questions
Research is about 'why' questions = explanations, relationships, comparisons, predictions, generalizations, and theories

Characteristics of good research 

* based on open system of thought 
* researchers examine data critically 
* researchers generalize and specify limits on their generalizations 

Basic types of research 

* exploratory research: tackling new problem/issue/topic about which little is known 
* testing-out research: find limits of previously proposed generalizations* 
* problem-solving research:involves variety of theories and methods, range across disciplines 

*PhD is primarily a research training exercise to go from beginner to full professional*

*'test-out research' is appropriate route since it wont throw you into deep end
i.e., apply methodology in new topic and make manifest its streights in giving new knowledge and theoretical insights; apply two competing theories to a new situation to see which is more powerful; design experiment to produce evidence to choose between them. can solve discipline-based problems

#Craft of doing research

1. watch established good researchers & note down systematically practices, skills and techniques they are using
2. practice these skills and get feedback on how well you are doing
   *DON'T let your thesis be first time you practice skills

Self-help and peer support groups 

* meeting regularly with others in your situation would help you and them 
* spend time with people interested in your work, who are aware of what you are doing, concerned about how you are feeling with regard to the research degress 
* it is easy to feel depressed and want to drop out 
* similar to AA meetings in sharing expereinces 
* they can help you meet deadlines (set time limit for a piece of work) 
* they can provide feedback on written work 

PhD form = background theory  + focal theory + data theory + contribution

* background theory = literature review
* focal theory = precise detail on what you are researching and why
* data theory = appropriateness and reliability of data sources
* contribution = evaluation of importance of work to the development of discipline

summary is not conclusion. (i.e. demonstrate how background theory and focal theory are now different as result of study)

Concept of originality in PhD

1. carrying out empirical work that hasn't been done before
2. making a synthesis that hasn't been made before
3. using already known material but with new interpretation
4. trying out something in this country that has previously only been done in other countries
5. taking a technique and applying it in a new area
6. bringing new evidence to bear on old issue
7. being cross-disciplinary and using different methodologies
8. looking at areas that people int he discipline haven't looked at before
9. adding to knowledge in a way that hasn't been done before

Ways in which students show originality

1. setting down a major piece of new information in writing for the first time
2. continuing a previously original piece of work
3. carrying out original work designed by the supervisor
4. providing a single original technique, observation, or result in unoriginal but competent piece of research
5. having many original ideas, methods, and interpretations all performed by others under the direction of the postgraduate
6. showing originality in testing somebody else's idea

# Writing thesis..

Keep separate drafts of a report/chapter and later examine to see whether succeeding drafts define/refine meaning more effectively than the earlier ones

* rewriting is an important factor in writing process
* don't postpone all writing til final year

Strategies to make writing more productive

1. make a rough plan
2. complete sections one at a time (maybe in order)
3. revise and redraft at least twice
4. plan to spend 2-5 hrs a week in term time on writing
5. find quiet conditions in white to write, and always in the same place
6. set goals and targets for yourself
7. get comments on early drafts

The PhD process (each of the following phases are chunks of ~4 months) 

* Background Theory 
    * Field of Interest 
    * Possible topics: think of 2-3 research proposals each 4pg long 
* Focal Theory 
    * Pilot Study: testing apparatus, data collection methods, sampling frames, availability of materials, etc (asking: will it work?) 
    * Thesis Proposal: make sure proposed research will address problem convincingly and is likely to make contribution 
* Data Theory 
    * Data Collection and analysis (2.5 terms): should know raw data by heard 
* Contribution 
    * Final writing up (3 terms) 

Managing supervisor 

* supervisors expect students to be independent 
* supervisors expect students to produce written work that is not just first draft 
* supervisors expect regular meetings with research students 
* supervisors expect their research students to be honest when reporting on their progress 
* supervisors expect their students to follow the advice given 
* supervisors expect students to be excited about work 

How to reduce the communication barrier

* appreciate the hidden time and effort that supervisor gives to you
* be open and honest for healthy relationship
