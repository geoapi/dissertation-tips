#Stats

Median page length is 225 pages (100-600 pages)
Mean page length is 240 pages.

Total can take 2625 hours = 15.175 work months = 225 pages

80% of studenets take 12-20 work months, to produce 130-390 pages.

#General Info

Questions:

* What do you want to do?
* How do you want to approach the problem?
* What methodology do you want to use?

Steps:

1. Select general area
2. Select several topics
3. Select and explore topic for proposal
4. Complate detailed chapter outlines
5. Complete literature search
6. Complete research & analysis
7. Complete text of dissertation
8. Acceptance by committee

Steps 1-4 should take about 2 months.
Step 5 -> 1 month
Step 6 -> 7 months
Step 7 -> 5 months

##Milestones

Year 1 Goals: 

* Prepare paper analyzing existing thought and research in an area of interest.
* Prepare paper analyzing existing thought in a proposed stream of research.

Year 2 Goals:

* Prepare paper proposing set of research topics for stream of research
* Do exploratory study and present results at a conference

Year 3 Goals:

* Prepare paper proposing improved theory & research for the stream
* Prepare paper describing the dissertation research and its results

##Pre dissertation Development

* Select general area for investigation. Do reading in an area, paty attention to research skills necessary to undersatnd basic background useful to someone in that area
* Coursework
* Dissertation ideas file. Every 6 months, roganize into skeleton outline, check "topic analysis form"

**Topic Analysis Form**

* Problem, hypothesis or question
* Importance of research
* Theory base for research
* Significant prior research
* Possible research approach or methodology
* Potential outcomes of research & importance of each 

**Strategy for selecting among topics:**

1. Make 2 lists for each topic. List expected chapters, list of major activities
2. Determine probability that outcomes will make contribution to knowledge, probability that committee will accept each of results as "contribution"

##Characteristics of good disertation topic:

* Research needed and interesting
* Suggestions from past dissertations
* Suggestsion by authorities in the field
* Theories and concepts without supporting research
* Expression of need by practitioners
* Generally accepted but unproposed superstitions
* Unproved/weakly approved assertations by authority
* Different approaches to testing important results

Presenting proposed research: 

1. Define similarities and differences
2. Evaluate potential contributions of proposed research.

Make a comparison table with these fields for literature review:

* Researcher
* Population
* Sample Size
* Experimental Method
* Type of reinforcement/schedule

##The Dissertation Proposal Sections

* Summary 1-2 pages
* Hypothesis/Problemt statement 1-3 pages
* Significance 1-2 pages
* Theory base 1-5 pages
* Prior research (extra material goes in appendix) 1-7 pages
* Approach/Methodology 2-8 pages
* Limitations & key assumptions 1-2 pages
* Contribution (for each outcome)
* Descriptions of propoased chapters 2-3 pages (see below)

**Chapters/Sections**

1. Introduction - general problem area, significance, approach, limitations
2. Description of what has been done in the past
3. Describe research methodology (multiple chapters). 1 each per technique or experiment.
4. Research results - results of chosen method, data presented, conceptual framework (lots of regurgitation)
5. Analysis of results - explains conclutions that can be drawn for data and implications of theory
6. Summary & conclusions - summary with emphasis on results and contribution


**Evaluating proposals:**

1. Does the proposal have imagination?
2. Is the problem stated clearly?
    a. Are hypotheses clear, unambiguous, and testable?
    b. If there are no hypotheses, are the objectives clearly stated? Can they be accomplished?
    c. Is the problem too large in scope?
3. Is the methodology feasible?
    a. Can data be collected?
    b. How will it be analyzed?
    c. Will the analysis allow the acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis?
    d. Is the population to be sampled overused?
4. What might results of analysis look like? (sketch tables/graph)
5. What are consequences to dissertation if
    a. experiment fails,
    b. data cannot be obtained
    c. only small amount of data exists
    d. the analysis is inconclusive
    e. the hypothesis is rejected/accepted?
6. Can major research activities be listed?
7. Can time estimates be attached to each major activity?
8. Is the dissertation trying to do too much?
9. If yes, what can be dropped/reduced to make project of manageable dimensions?
10. Is dissertation portable?
