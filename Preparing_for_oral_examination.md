Revising a complete thesis and preparing for viva at the same time:

* Take max 3 sheets ruled paper and draw vertical line down center of each. You now have about 35x2 half lines, each representing one page of your thesis. * Number each line and over course of next 2 weeks... write on each half line the main idea contained on page of your thesis.

Questions asked about thesis:
* Does the thesis show enough depth?
* Does the student demonstrate adequate critical understanding of the issues involved?
* Has the student sufficiently integrated the research material to indicate attractive future lines of work?
