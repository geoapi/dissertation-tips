The structure refers to specific format used in MIS field of research. In addition, consider the following questions as you write: Does literature review relate to data? Did you test concepts in literature review? Are presented findings related? How do they change or reinforce ideas in the literature review? What contributions are made from your work?

# What is in a research design?

1. Intial literature review
2. Research questions arising from literature review
3. Research method:

   * Sampling strategy
   * Research protocol
   * Description of method to be employed (with justification)

# What is in a research write-up (paper or dissertation(!)?

1. Motivation
2. Literature review: provides a structure (conceptual framework) for the concepts underlying the study
3. Description of Method (including site, sampling, approach, & justification)
4. Research findings: data are presented, with quotes and examples to make these "real."

   * Data should be structured according to the conceptual framework derived from the literature.

5. Discussion of findings: a synthesis of findings is reslated to the literature, to draw conclusions about what has been discovered. Limitations are addressed (briefly and positively)

   * The discussion should be structured according to the conceptual framework elements.
   * The conceptual framework may be confirmed or developed according to the findings.

6. Conclusions: the synthesis of findings is summarized, the contribution to research domain knowledge, practice, and method are made explicit, and the implications for research and practice are discussed. (*Not all contributions are required*)

   * The most major contribution is probably the contribution to domain knowledge that results from any development of the conceptual framework.
