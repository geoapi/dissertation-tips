What is a problem statment?
Library & Information Science Research 29 p307-309

Hernon & Metoyer (1993, 1994) discovered nine attributes:

1. clarity and precision (a well-written statement does not make sweeping generalizations and irresponsible statmeents).
2. identification of what would be studied, while avoiding the use of value-laden words and terms;
3. identification of an overarching question and key factors or variables;
4. identification of key concepts and terms;
5. articulation of the study's boundaries orparameters;
6. some generalizability;
7. conveyance of the study's importance, benefits, and justification (regardless of the type of research, it is important to address the "so what" question and to demonstrate that the research is not trivial);
8. no use of unncessary jargon; and
9. conveyance of more than the mere gathering of descriptive data providing a snapshot

Components of a problem statement

1. lead-in;
2. declaration of originality (e.g. mentioning a knowledge void, which would be supported by the literature review);
3. indication of the central focus of the study; and
4. explanation of study significance or the benefits to be derived from an investigation of the problem.

* study significance must survive the "so what" question as well as the "how so" questions

"Research is like dealing with a set of propositions in a debate or an argument adhering to the principles of logic"
